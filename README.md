## Employee Performance Analysis Project Documentation
# Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict employee performance based on various factors. The model is created using machine learning, specifically with the XGBoost algorithm, which has been chosen due to its superior performance in terms of R2 score compared to linear regression and random forest models.

# Technologies Used
Python
Flask (web framework)
HTML/CSS (for the frontend)
Bootstrap (for responsive design)
XGBoost (machine learning model)
Pickle (for model serialization)

# Model Development
- Data Preparation
- The dataset contains various features related to employee performance such as:

Quarter
Department
Day
Team
Targeted Productivity
SMV
Over Time
Incentive
Idle Time
Idle Men
No. of Style Changes
No. of Workers
Month
Model Selection
Three different models were tested:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Among these, XGBoost provided the best R2 score, making it the chosen model for this project.

# Model Training
The model was trained using the XGBoost algorithm, which is known for its high performance and accuracy. The data was split into training and testing sets, and various hyperparameters were tuned to optimize the model's performance.

# Model Serialization
The trained XGBoost model was serialized using the pickle library to be used in the Flask application for making predictions.
